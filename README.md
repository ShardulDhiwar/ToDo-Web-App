# 📋 Simple To-Do Web App

This is a **basic To-Do List web application** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It allows users to add and manage tasks categorized into three sections:  
➡️ **Today's Tasks**  
➡️ **This Week's Tasks**  
➡️ **This Month's Tasks**

This project is built purely with **frontend technologies** and runs in the browser — no backend or database.

## 🔑 Features

- Add new tasks to **Today**, **Week**, or **Month** sections.
- Mark tasks as **completed** (visually different from pending ones).
- Delete tasks when they are no longer needed.
- Clean, simple, and user-friendly interface.
- Fully responsive — works well on both **mobile** and **desktop** screens.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5 for page structure.
